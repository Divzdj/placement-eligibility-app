#  Placement Eligibility Streamlit App

Hi! This is a project I built as part of my GUVI + IIT MiniProject to simulate a real-world placement management system using Python, SQL, and Streamlit.

It was a great way for me to bring together what I’ve been learning in data science — from generating realistic datasets and writing SQL queries, to building an interactive web app where users can explore data and gain insights.

##  Live Application

##  Project Overview

The goal of this app is to help placement teams or EdTech platforms evaluate student readiness for placements by filtering candidates based on:

- Programming performance
- Soft skill scores
- Mock interview results

Users can interact with the app to:
- Apply eligibility filters
- Preview student records from different tables
- View visual insights using SQL + Streamlit



##  Technologies I Used

I chose lightweight and beginner-friendly tools that helped me focus more on logic and less on setup:

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Streamlit** – for UI
- **SQLite3** – simple and easy to use locally
- **Faker** – for generating realistic fake student data
- **Pandas & Numpy** – for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib / Streamlit Charts** – for visualization



##  What I Learned

- Creating **relational datasets** using `Faker` and Python
- Writing **modular OOP code** to manage database tasks
- Structuring and loading **SQL queries** from a `.sql` file
- Building a **multi-tab Streamlit app** with filters and charts
- Using GitHub for **version control and collaboration**
